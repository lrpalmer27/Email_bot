Dear <<insert name>>,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you on behalf of DETechnologies, a student-run engineering team at Memorial University of Newfoundland.

We are embarking on an exciting project to develop a fully-functional Rotating Detonation Rocket Engine, with the aim of competing against other Canadian universities at TheLaunchCanada rocketry competition in August 2024.

Our team is on the cusp of beginning the manufacturing phase of our engine, and we are actively seeking support to bring this project to fruition. We believe that <<insert company>>'s support would be invaluable in helping us achieve our goals and represent Atlantic Canada on the national stage.

We would be thrilled to discuss our project in more detail and explore how we can work together. Please feel free to reach out to us, visit our website: www.DETechnologies.ca, or consult the attached information packet to learn more about our work.

Thank you for considering our request to support local engineering design teams. We look forward to the possibility of collaborating with your team.
Best regards,

Logan Palmer
DETechnologies Team Member
